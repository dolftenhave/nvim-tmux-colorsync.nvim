# nvim-tmux-colorsync

This plugin aims to make it easy to sync your current neovim colourscheme for tmux to use. The idea was born from me wanting to have some way of matching my nvim status bar colours with tmux when swithing between modes.

## planned features

- Colour syncing of nvim theme for use in tmux.
- Live updating of tmux accent colours to math nvim (eg. when changing modes in nvim).
